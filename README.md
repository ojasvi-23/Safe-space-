# SafeSpace: Per-Feature Explainable Multimodal Stress Detection and Narrative Feedback System

This repository contains the research paper titled  
**"Per-Feature Explainable Multimodal Stress Detection and Narrative Feedback System"**,  
currently under submission (2025).

## 📄 Abstract

SafeSpace is a real-time, explainable stress detection system that leverages both physiological (GSR, HRV, SpO₂, Temp, PPG) and behavioral (keystroke, mouse dynamics) signals. Each modality is modeled independently using lightweight machine learning models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression), and scored using a tanh-based function to ensure consistent, per-feature explanations.

A local instruction-tuned language model is used to generate natural language summaries, offering personalized feedback to users — distinguishing between distress and eustress in high-pressure environments.

## 🧠 Core Contributions

- 📊 Multimodal signal processing (physiological + behavioral)
- ⚙️ Per-feature explainable ML using tanh-based scoring
- 🧾 Narrative feedback generation via instruction-tuned LLMs
- ⏱️ Real-time stress classification based on personalized baselines
